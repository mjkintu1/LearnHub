            <h2>The Scientific Method</h2>
            <img src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.pXtMZ74t16y2DlFwUGJ0QAHaEK&pid=Api" alt="Scientific Method Diagram" style="display: block; margin: auto;">
            <p>The scientific method is a step-by-step procedure for conducting experiments and gathering evidence. It involves observation, hypothesis formation, experimentation, and drawing conclusions.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: If you observe that plants grow faster in sunlight than in the dark, you might hypothesize that sunlight affects plant growth. To test this, you would conduct an experiment comparing the growth of plants in light
                and darkness, and then draw conclusions based on the results.</p>

            <h2>Branches of Science</h2>
            <img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.b9fKRDH8lAc6ocwH58jTOwHaFP&pid=Api" alt="Branches of Science" style="display: block; margin: auto;">
            <p>Science is divided into several main branches that study different aspects of the natural world. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physics</strong>: Studies matter, energy, and their interactions. Example: Laws of motion, gravity, thermodynamics.</li>
                <li><strong>Chemistry</strong>: Focuses on substances, their properties, and reactions. Example: Chemical bonding, acid-base reactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Biology</strong>: Studies living organisms and their interactions. Example: Cell biology, genetics, evolution.</li>
                <li><strong>Earth Science</strong>: Studies the Earth and its processes. Example: Plate tectonics, weather, geology.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Fun Science Experiments</h2>
            <img src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Cf-2gRp-RKv4Ae-YY3nOLQHaI9&pid=Api" alt="Science Experiment" style="display: block; margin: auto;">
            <p>Hands-on experiments are a great way to engage with science and understand the concepts in a fun, interactive way. Below are some easy-to-do experiments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Volcano Eruption</strong>: Create a volcano using baking soda and vinegar to simulate an eruption. This demonstrates an acid-base reaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Density Experiment</strong>: Layer liquids of different densities (e.g., honey, water, and oil) in a jar to see how they don't mix.</li>
                <li><strong>Magnetic Fields</strong>: Use iron filings and a magnet to visualize magnetic fields.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Periodic Table</h2>
            <img src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.KyxAc9e5U0XvH7dp-7wKNwHaFj&pid=Api" alt="Periodic Table" style="display: block; margin: auto;">
            <p>The Periodic Table organizes all known elements by atomic number. It helps scientists predict the properties of elements and understand their relationships. Elements are arranged in rows (periods) and columns (groups).</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: - Group 1: Alkali metals (e.g., Sodium, Potassium) - Group 17: Halogens (e.g., Chlorine, Fluorine)</p>
